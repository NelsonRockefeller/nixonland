Now the whims of fate gave the young Vice-President Richard Nixon the helm of the greatest position in the land, facing against the raging waves of the Cold War and its ever-changing tides both at home and abroad.</p> <ul><li>With the election one year away, Richard Nixon now finds himself with precious little time to prove himself to the nation and his party that he is capable of being a torchbearer to the legacy of the beloved President,</li><li>as Adlai Stevenson II, once thoroughly defeated by Eisenhower, now has returned and preparing for a renewed offensive on a mourning GOP.</li> ",

Born as a commoner in some forgotten corner of California, Nixon has fought tooth and nail to climb up the ranks of society, from the Navy, to the House of Representatives, the Senate, there acquiring a reputation as a fierce anti-communist, until arriving at the Vice-Presidency, one heartbeat away from the presidency. Now fate has played a cruel trick and Eisenhower's heart has indeed stopped beating, placing the burden of the role of President upon the boy from Whittier.</p><p>With just one year away from election, Nixon is an uncouth man, an intruder viewed with suspicion by the plotting party elites who sought to remove this man from the vice presidency had Eisenhower lived to see 1956. Embattled yet inexperienced, Nixon finds precious little time to define himself in face of the sudden change in leadership.</p>",

The Republicans have now lost five Presidential elections in a row, and have no obvious standard-bearer to break the trend in 1952.
